          <p class="lead">
            We've all been there. You're building something great, relying on a trusted library, and then... silence.
            No updates. No security patches. No response to issues. The project is abandoned, and you're left holding
            the bag with mounting technical debt and security risks.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            Take MMDetection. Still the most powerful object detection framework out there. But try installing it today
            and you'll hit a wall of dependency conflicts and broken builds. It hasn't seen a meaningful update in about
            a year. Python moves forward. PyTorch releases new versions. Your environment breaks. The only solution?
            Fork it internally, patch it yourself, and hope you can keep up with the ecosystem. That's not development—that's
            maintenance hell.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            And MMDetection isn't unique. It's everywhere. Utility libraries with tens of thousands of dependents. Testing
            frameworks entire teams rely on. CLI tools that have become part of workflows. All going silent, one by one.
            The problem isn't just inconvenience—it's security vulnerabilities that never get patched, breaking changes
            in dependencies that never get addressed, and teams forced to choose between technical debt or painful migrations.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            Here's the irony: the Python ecosystem has never been friendlier. Astral's UV package manager has eliminated
            most of the dependency hell that used to plague Python development. Installation is fast. Environments are clean.
            Conflicts are rare. The tooling that made complex installation processes a nightmare five years ago? Largely solved.
            Which means maintaining projects like MMDetection shouldn't be the painful slog it once was. The infrastructure
            exists. The tools exist. What's missing is active maintenance.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            And it's not just package management. LLMs have made code modernization almost trivial. Want to convert an
            entire codebase to static typing? Feed it to Claude or GPT-4 and you'll have type hints across thousands of
            lines in minutes. The result? Radically fewer bugs, dramatically better readability, and IDE autocomplete that
            actually works. Tasks that used to take weeks of careful refactoring now take an afternoon. The barrier to
            bringing old projects up to modern standards has collapsed.
          </p>

          <p class="lead">
            But here's the thing: abandoned doesn't have to mean dead. The open-source community has a habit of
            picking up where others leave off. Forks emerge. Maintainers step up. Projects get a second life.
            The problem? Finding these actively maintained alternatives is like searching for a needle in a haystack
            of 100 million GitHub repositories.

            That's where this site comes in. We document popular projects that have gone quiet—measured by lack of
            commits, unaddressed security vulnerabilities, and years of radio silence—and match them with their
            maintained alternatives. Projects that offer drop-in replacements, active security patches, and modern
            compatibility.

          <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
          <p>
            When widely-used libraries stop receiving updates, projects depending on them face:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Security vulnerabilities - No patches for newly discovered exploits</li>
            <li>Compatibility issues - Breaking changes with modern dependencies</li>
            <li>Technical debt - Increasingly difficult to maintain and migrate</li>
            <li>Supply chain risks - Targets for malicious takeovers</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>The Solution</h2>
          <p>
            Community-maintained forks provide active maintenance, modern compatibility, security patches,
            and often serve as drop-in replacements with minimal migration effort.
